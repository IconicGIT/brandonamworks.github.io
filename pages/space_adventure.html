						<h2>About the Project</h2>
						<p>
							In this project our team was asked to replicate a pinball browser game from the internet.
							Our team chose the game <i>Space Adventure</i>, a pinball game that can be found in many
							game webpages. It
							is
							characterized by having a space-themed background, interactables and sounds.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main objective when making this game was to develop it by using <b>Box2D</b>, a 2D
							phisics library, in c++, in order to learn how to use and implement its features into a
							real, playable game.
						</p>

						<p>
							This project was made along side with <b><a
									href="https://github.com/rastabrandy02">rastabrandy02</a></b> and <b><a
									href="https://github.com/fakefarreraspol">fakefarreraspol</a></b>.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<h2>Features</h2>
						<span class="image left"><img src="../images/space_adventure/pinball_parts.png" alt="" />
						</span>

						<br>
						<b>1.</b> The stars represents the total points the player has managed to obtain. Reaching a
						high score will grant you an extra ball! The
						number of tries left is marked by the remaining balls.
						<br>
						<b>2.</b> The colored capsules are interactable elements that turn on when the ball passes
						through them. If all capsules are lighted, extra points are awarded!
						<br>
						<b>3.</b> These ufo-shaped bumpers grant points whenever the ball touches them. They also eject
						the ball on contact.
						<br>
						<b>4.</b> These side mini-bumbers, light on on contact as well. Turn all 5 of them on to unlock
						an extra lateral bumper!
						<br>
						<b>5.</b> These big red bumpers serve to strategically launch the ball through the map. They
						grant no points on contact.
						<br>
						<b>6.</b> This is the ball launcher. Hold [Down] to compress the string. Upon releasing it, the
						more compressed it is, the more it will launch the ball!
						<br>
						<b>7.</b> These are the main flippers. Move them with the lateral arrows to spin them and smack
						the ball back in the map!
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>In this project I was an active developer along with my peers, where I worked on:</p>
						- The flippers' behavior. <br>
						- Big and Mini bumpers. (Behavior and Animations). <br>
						- Capsule combo. (Behavior and Animations). <br>
						- Fonts & Pause UI elements. <br>
						- Main game looping. <br>
						- High Score system. <br>

						<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
						While we call it a "recreation" of the original game "Space Adventures", it does not contain all
						the features that the original game had. The game was selected as a frame for us to practice the use of the
						library Box2D, and then we picked the features to recreate that best allowed us to use the different available
						features that the library had.
