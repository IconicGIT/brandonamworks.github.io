						<h2>About the Engine</h2>
						<p>Separaty Engine is a game engine developed by our class in year 3 of <i>UPC: Videogame Design
								and
								Development Degree</i>
							which objective was to serve as, apart from learning the basic elements that a game engine
							must
							have,as a platform to develop a basic particle system in order to prepare for our upcoming
							project, currently known as <i><a href="../pages/gotg.html">Guardians of the Galaxy:
									Battle for the Universe</a></i>. <br><br>
							The engine is based on a full Entity Component System similar to Unity, and it's meant to
							support basic elements in an engine, such as asset management, a hierarchy to access
							gameobjects, inspector to edit gameobjects, 3D rendering, saving and loading information
							using
							json serialization and our custom Particle System.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Contributions</h2>
						<p>
							The engine was build almost from the ground up by me along with <b><a
									href="https://github.com/GerardMartinez02">GerardMartinez02</a></b> as part of our
							studies in the degree <i>Videogame Design and
								Development</i> at UPC.
						</p>

						<h2>About the engine</h2>
						<i>Separaty Engine</i> was developed as in order to learn the fundamental aspects that make up a
						game engine. This includes the options to save, load and change settings of the engine,
						importing
						assets such as 3D models and textures, a hierarchy to manipulate game objects, or an inspector,
						among other elements detailed below.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/separaty/full_view.png" alt="" />
							<div class="center">Full view of the Editor</div>
							<br>
							<h3>Top left menu</h3>
							The top left menu has many options distributed in the sections <i>File</i>, <i>Edit</i>,
							<i>Game
								Object</i>, <i>Window</i> and <i>Help</i>. Within these menus, the buttons in white
							serve
							their described function, while the ones marked in gray are placeholders for features that
							didn't make it in the end.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>File</h3>
							<b>New Scene</b>: Creates a new scene within the engine. <br>
							<b>Save</b>: Saves the current scene. <br>
							<b>Load</b>: Loads the data of a scene from the computer's memory. <br>
							<b>Exit</b>: Closes the application. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Edit</h3>
							<b>Preferences...</b>: Opens the <i>Preferences</i> window, where the user can changes
							settins
							from the User Interface, the Window of the application and the FOV of the camera. <br>
							<b>Show Application Data</b>: Opens the <i>Show Application Data</i> window, where the user
							can
							see
							information about the application's name, organization, framerate, hardware and the devices'
							inputs in real time. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Game Object</h3>
							<b>Create Empty</b>: Creates a game object with basic components and data.<br>
							<b>Create Primitives</b>: Shows a list of buttons "<i>Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder,
								Pyramid,
								Cone, Plane</i>". Upon pressing one, it creates a game object with the mesh described
							and
							basic material, among with other basic components. <br>
							<b>Effects</b>: Creates a game object called Particle Emitter with the components associated
							with the particle emitter and system. <br>
							<b>Light & Audio</b>: Show placeholder buttons for adding light and audio related game
							objects.
							<br>
							<b>Camera</b>: Creates a game object named Camera with the Camera components. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_4.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>View</h3>
							<b>Render Options</b>: Toggling On or Off these buttons change how the elements are drawn in
							the
							scene, affecting the <i>Ambient Occlusion</i>, <i>Color Material</i>, <i>Face Culling</i>,
							aplying of <i>Depth Test</i>,
							<i>Lightning</i> or setting the view in <i>Wireframe</i> mode.
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_5.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Window</h3>
							Here can be opened the windows <i>Hierarchy</i>, <i>Inspector</i>, <i>Assets</i>,
							<i>Output</i>,
							<i>Play & Stop</i> and indivigual <i>Play & Stop</i> windows in case they are closed.
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>


							<span class="image right"><img src="../images/separaty/menu_6.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Help</h3>
							In this section the user can see the details of the Engine, such as the creators and their
							contacts, the libraries used in theengine and its License. <br>
							There is also a section to report bugs and make comments about the engine.

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h1>Main Features</h1>
							<h2>the hierarchy</h2>

							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/hierarchy.png" alt="" /></span>
							The hierarchy is the place where all game objects are ordered and visible for the user to
							select
							and modify.

							Each game object has 3 buttons associated: <br>the <i>Name</i>, the <i>Delete Button</i>,
							and
							the <i>Create Child</i>, marked in blue, red and green respectively: <br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/gameobject.png" alt="" /></span>

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>The Inspector</h2>
							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/inspector.png" alt="" /></span>
							The inspector holds the components of the game objects. Here it is possible to edit its
							<i>Name</i> (shown in green) and components.
							<br>
							<br>
							The basic components of a game object are the <b>Transform</b>, the <b>Mesh Renderer</b> and
							its <b>Texture</b>.

							<br><br>
							Other components include: <br><br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/comp_camera.png" alt="" />
								<div class="left">Camera Component</div>
							</span><br><br><br><br><br><br>
							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/comp_particle_emitter.png" alt="" />
								<div class="left">Particle Emitter Component</div>
							</span><br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2>The Output</h2>
							<span class="image left"><img src="../images/separaty/output.png" alt="" /></span>
							This window shows messages created in the internal code. It show messages when assets are
							imported and created, as well as other data that may be relevant. This was useful to see
							processes while developing the engine.

							<br>

							<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
							This project had the objective to learn about the basic elements that conform an engine,
							which
							is the support for importing assets, creating scenes, add, edit and work with game objects
							and
							additionally, the creation of a basic particle system. There are many details that weren't
							added
							due to time constraints or because they were non-essential for the main objective of the
							project.
